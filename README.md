# Framework.Lite
FrameWork Lite is a powerful, unique toolkit for PHP. Developers are supplied with a prebuilt pathing system and global schematic for creating sophisticated interior and exterior infrastructures.

### Pathing References
[filesystem] /path/to/folder/
[filesystem] /path/to/file.ext
[filesystem] /path/to/database:name/table:name/row:value/column:value

[datasystem] /path/to/file.php/variable[key]

[crumbs] key/key:value/...
[keypairs] key:value,value/...
[matrices] object::property:value,property:value/...
[graphs] /path/to/file/segment/operation(params)
[circuits] TO-DO // like redstone in Minecraft, circuits will be used to create logarithmic sensors and relays, this would add support for interactive program conditioning and filtration, this is exceptionally difficult for me to do by myself, as I struggle with Mathematics.

### Structures

Structures contain surfaces.... There's a lot to the bi-directional structure/surface relationship. I've made something I don't know how to fully know how to explain.

### Surfaces

Surfaces contain structures.... There's a lot to the bi-directional structure/surface relationship. I've made something I don't know how to fully know how to explain.

### Concentric-Cyclical-Inclusion

This system uses cyclical inclusion systems to weave intricate relationships between structures and surfaces, and distribute canvas information across a uniform interface infrastructure.
